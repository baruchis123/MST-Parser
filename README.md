# MST Parser
### In this section of the NLP course in the Computer Science program at Hebrew University, we learned about different models designed to predict correct dependencies (how words of a sentence interact with one another) between words of a sentence. One of these models is the MST Parser which predicts edges of a graph between the different words of a sentence and then runs one of the many algorithms used for finding a Maximum Spanning Tree (inference of the model) over said graph to find the most likely predictions.
